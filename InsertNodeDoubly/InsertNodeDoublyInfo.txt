Info: Used while loop to iterate through doubly linked-list. When the given data is
greater than the current node's and less than 'next''s data, insert a new node
with the given data. Also checked if the data is less than the head's data beforehand
and if the data is greater than that of every node in the linked-list after. If either
is true, set the new node as the head of the tail respectively.
