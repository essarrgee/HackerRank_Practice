Info: Create two hashmaps/dictionaries and store characters as keys and the number of
times they appear in the string as values for both respective strings. Iterate through
the strings again and determine whether each character key in their corresponding hashmap
has a larger value than the character key of the other string's hashmap. If true,
reduce the value of the character key by one and add one to the deletion counter.

Other: 
C++ & C#:
-Instead of iterating through hashmap, iterate through the 
strings instead.
C++:
-No need to check whether map contains key yet; value for key is already at 0.
C#:
-When comparing values between dictionaries, must check if other dictionary has key yet.
If not and value is greater than 0, make a deletion.
