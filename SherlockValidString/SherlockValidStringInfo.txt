Info: Create two hashmaps, one to store each character in the given string as a key and
the number of times they appear as the value, and the other to store each of those
values as keys and the number of times those values occur as values. After obtaining the
second aforementioned hashmap, check the amount of keys in it. 

If the amount exceeds 2, return "NO". If the amount is equal to 1, return "YES", 
since this denotes that every character in the string already occurs the same amount. 
Otherwise, with the amount being 2, this shows that there are 
only characters that all occur "x" amount of times and a character that...
-occurs "x+1" amount of times = removing one instance of that character would mean every 
	character will occur the same amount.
-occurs "1" amount of times = every character already occurs the same amount except for
	this one and removing it would satisfy the requirement.
If either of these are true, return "YES".
