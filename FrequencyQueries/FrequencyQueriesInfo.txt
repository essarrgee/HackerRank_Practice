Info: 
Create two dictionaries/hashmap: 
1. Key: Each value inserted into the array.
Value = Number of times it appears in the array. 
2. Key: Number of times a value in the array shows up.
Value: A list of values that show up that many times.
Create a result list containing the results of every '3' query.
Iterate through every query.
For every '1' and '2' query, update both dictionaries respectively. 
For every '3' query,add a '1' to the result list if the second dictionary contains a 
key of the specified amount and the list contained in its value is not empty. 
Otherwise, add a '0' to the result list instead.
After iterating is done, return the result list.

Other Notes:
C#: 
-When checking if a list is empty, do not check if its value at index [0] is empty. Use
(List.Count <= 0) or (!List.Any()) instead.
-Using List.Remove() may cost more to the complexity.
