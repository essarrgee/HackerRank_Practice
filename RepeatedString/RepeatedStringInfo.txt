Info: Used for-loop to get positions of all 'a' in base input string and stored in list.
Used modulus to get remainder of input n when divided by length of base input string.
Took the quotient of input n by input string length and multiplied it by the
number of 'a' in input string, then iterated through list of all 'a' positions to get the
remaining 'a' counts.
