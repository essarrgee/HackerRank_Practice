Info: Create a new array of size k to hold each customer's total cost amount. Sort
the given price array and iterate through it backwards. For every iteration,
add the cost of the item to the current customer and add one to the current index tracker 
for the customer array. Wrap back around to zero if the tracker exceeds the size of the 
customer array. For every wrap around, add one to the priceIncrease variable, which is used
to calculate the cost for each customer in (currentCost * (1 + priceIncrease)).
At the end, add up all the total costs for all customers and return the final total.
