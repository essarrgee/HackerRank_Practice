Runtime: O(n)

Info: Sort the array and iterate through it. For every iteration, check the difference
between the value at (i+k-1) index and the current index (i). If that difference is
less than the minDifference variable (initialized to infinity), set the variable
to that difference. Return minDifference at the end.

Other Notes:
-Even after sorting, arr[k-1] - arr[0] does not immediately produce the minimum unfairness
value, since, for example, in an array of {1, 19, 20} with k = 2, arr[k-1] - arr[0] = 18,
when the answer should be arr[2] - arr[1] = 1.
-There is no need to check beyond arr[k-1] - arr[0] when calculating the difference for 
each iteration after having sorted arr.
