Info: There is no need to swap the values in the array, since the prompt just asks
for the number of swaps.
Iterate through the given array and iterate from the current value - 2 to the
current value to find values larger than the current value. For every larger value found
within the range of 2, add one to a counter that keeps track of the number of swaps.
In the initial loop, if a value is found that exceeds 2 swapped indices, a 'break' is
called and prints out 'Too chaotic' instead.
