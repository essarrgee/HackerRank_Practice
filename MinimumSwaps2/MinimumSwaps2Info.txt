Info: Create a hashmap to store each number in the given array as a key and their
respective positions as their key. Iterate through the given array and compare the
current value and its index. Since the resulting array is sorted from 1 to n, the current
value and the index + 1 must match. Using the hashmap as reference, swap the current value
with the index's matching value to their matching indices and add 1 to the swap counter.
