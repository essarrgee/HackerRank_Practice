Info: Created a hashmap to store each word in the 'dictionary' vector as a key and
the number of times they appear in the vector as the value. Iterating through the
'note' vector, checked if the hashmap contained a key with the matching name
as each string while also making sure the number of times the 'note' vector does
not contain more of one word than the value stored in the hashmap.
