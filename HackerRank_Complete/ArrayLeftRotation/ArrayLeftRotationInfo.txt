Info: Iterate through the given array and shift each value by 'd' indeces. To get the new
position, add the given 'd' to the value's current index and set that value to
that sum index in a new array. If the new index was under 0 (out of bounds), take that
index and add it to the array's length to get the wrap-around index.
