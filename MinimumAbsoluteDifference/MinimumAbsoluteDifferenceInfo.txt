Info: Nested for-loop would be too slow. Sort the given array with built-in sort function.
Iterate through the sorted array and check differences between each consecutive 
pair of numbers, storing the smallest obtained difference larger of equal to 0.
No need to check differences of numbers beyond an index difference of 2 since the 
array is sorted, meaning their value differences will always be larger 
than those of index difference 1.
